# 📚 CATEGORY: Database Design

## 001. Data Modeling

### 001.001 Entities and Relationships

#### 🔹 Core Concepts
- Definition: Understand Entities and Relationships as it applies to Database Design, including the problem it solves and the boundary it owns.
- Internal working: Trace the flow from input to processing to output, naming the state transitions, contracts, and dependencies involved.
- Key principles: Prefer explicit contracts, measurable behavior, isolated responsibilities, and designs that degrade predictably under stress.

#### 🔹 Deep Concepts
- Hidden behaviors: Watch for implicit defaults, lifecycle timing, ordering guarantees, cache state, retries, and framework/runtime abstractions that hide real cost.
- Edge cases: Empty input, duplicate input, partial failure, timeout, cancellation, race conditions, version mismatch, clock skew, and inconsistent downstream state.
- Internal mechanisms: Identify queues, buffers, schedulers, execution contexts, network boundaries, storage paths, locks, indexes, or render phases behind the abstraction.
- Performance implications: Measure latency, throughput, memory, CPU, I/O, bundle size, query cost, and tail behavior instead of trusting average-case intuition.

#### 🔹 Code-Level Understanding
- Example: Implement a small Database Design scenario where Entities and Relationships has a visible contract, typed inputs, explicit error handling, and test coverage.
- Anti-patterns: Leaky abstraction, over-broad shared state, hidden global configuration, unbounded retries, missing cancellation, and logging without correlation IDs.
- Best practices: Keep interfaces narrow, validate at boundaries, model failures explicitly, add observability at decision points, and make behavior reproducible in tests.

#### 🔹 Real-World Usage
- Where used in production: Entities and Relationships appears in systems that need predictable behavior across deploys, teams, and traffic patterns.
- Example systems: Payments, chat, SaaS workspaces, dashboards, notification systems, search, audit trails, developer platforms, and internal admin tools.

#### 🔹 Architecture Decisions
- Multiple approaches: Compare simple in-process handling, framework-provided primitives, external managed services, and custom infrastructure.
- Trade-offs: Balance correctness, latency, cost, operational burden, team familiarity, release risk, and long-term maintainability.
- When to use what: Use the simplest option that satisfies current scale and correctness needs, then move complexity behind stable interfaces when pressure is proven.

#### 🔹 Interview Focus
- Common questions: Explain Entities and Relationships, describe how it works internally, and show how you would implement or operate it in Database Design.
- Tricky scenarios: Debug intermittent failures, high tail latency, duplicated work, stale data, memory growth, or behavior that changes only under load.
- Follow-up depth: Be ready to discuss instrumentation, rollback plans, migration strategy, data consistency, and how the design changes at 10x scale.

```text
Input / trigger
  -> boundary validation
  -> Data Modeling decision point
  -> Entities and Relationships execution path
  -> side effects / state change
  -> observable result
  -> retry, rollback, or compensation if needed
```

#### 🔹 Failure Scenarios
- Dependency timeout or unavailable downstream service.
- Invalid, duplicated, stale, or out-of-order input.
- Configuration drift between environments.
- Resource exhaustion: CPU, memory, network, database connections, queue depth, or browser main-thread time.
- Partial success where one side effect commits and another fails.

#### 🔹 Debugging Strategies
- Reproduce with minimal inputs, then add concurrency, load, and failure injection.
- Inspect logs, traces, metrics, heap snapshots, profiles, network captures, query plans, or rendered output depending on the layer.
- Verify assumptions about ordering, ownership, retries, idempotency, caching, and lifecycle timing.
- Compare healthy and unhealthy paths using correlation IDs and timestamps.

#### 🔹 Optimization Techniques
- Remove unnecessary work before adding infrastructure.
- Batch, cache, debounce, stream, paginate, lazy-load, or precompute only where measurements show pressure.
- Add backpressure, timeouts, circuit breakers, and bounded queues around expensive paths.
- Optimize for p95/p99 behavior, not just happy-path averages.

## 004. Production Data

### 004.001 Migrations

#### 🔹 Core Concepts
- Definition: Understand Migrations as it applies to Database Design, including the problem it solves and the boundary it owns.
- Internal working: Trace the flow from input to processing to output, naming the state transitions, contracts, and dependencies involved.
- Key principles: Prefer explicit contracts, measurable behavior, isolated responsibilities, and designs that degrade predictably under stress.

#### 🔹 Deep Concepts
- Hidden behaviors: Watch for implicit defaults, lifecycle timing, ordering guarantees, cache state, retries, and framework/runtime abstractions that hide real cost.
- Edge cases: Empty input, duplicate input, partial failure, timeout, cancellation, race conditions, version mismatch, clock skew, and inconsistent downstream state.
- Internal mechanisms: Identify queues, buffers, schedulers, execution contexts, network boundaries, storage paths, locks, indexes, or render phases behind the abstraction.
- Performance implications: Measure latency, throughput, memory, CPU, I/O, bundle size, query cost, and tail behavior instead of trusting average-case intuition.

#### 🔹 Code-Level Understanding
- Example: Implement a small Database Design scenario where Migrations has a visible contract, typed inputs, explicit error handling, and test coverage.
- Anti-patterns: Leaky abstraction, over-broad shared state, hidden global configuration, unbounded retries, missing cancellation, and logging without correlation IDs.
- Best practices: Keep interfaces narrow, validate at boundaries, model failures explicitly, add observability at decision points, and make behavior reproducible in tests.

#### 🔹 Real-World Usage
- Where used in production: Migrations appears in systems that need predictable behavior across deploys, teams, and traffic patterns.
- Example systems: Payments, chat, SaaS workspaces, dashboards, notification systems, search, audit trails, developer platforms, and internal admin tools.

#### 🔹 Architecture Decisions
- Multiple approaches: Compare simple in-process handling, framework-provided primitives, external managed services, and custom infrastructure.
- Trade-offs: Balance correctness, latency, cost, operational burden, team familiarity, release risk, and long-term maintainability.
- When to use what: Use the simplest option that satisfies current scale and correctness needs, then move complexity behind stable interfaces when pressure is proven.

#### 🔹 Interview Focus
- Common questions: Explain Migrations, describe how it works internally, and show how you would implement or operate it in Database Design.

## 🚀 Hidden Advanced Topics (Senior Level)

- Production-only failure modes: retries that amplify outages, cache stampedes, slow memory leaks, dependency brownouts, noisy-neighbor effects, and hidden coupling between release trains.
- Scaling issues most teams discover late: p99 latency, queue backlog growth, lock contention, hydration or rendering bottlenecks, oversized payloads, schema evolution, and observability cardinality explosions.
- Senior-level concerns: migration safety, backward compatibility, ownership boundaries, cost visibility, compliance constraints, graceful degradation, and operability during incidents.
- Advanced design pressure: deciding when to split responsibilities, when to centralize platform capability, and when local duplication is cheaper than shared abstraction.
- Production readiness: runbooks, dashboards, SLOs, alert thresholds, rollback paths, feature flags, capacity plans, and failure drills.

## 🧠 Mental Models

- Start from first principles: What invariant must hold, what can fail, who owns the state, and what must be observable?
- Think in boundaries: API boundary, runtime boundary, team boundary, data boundary, trust boundary, and deployment boundary.
- Separate correctness from performance: first prove behavior, then measure cost, then optimize the bottleneck.
- Prefer explicit trade-offs: latency vs consistency, flexibility vs simplicity, autonomy vs standardization, speed vs safety, and cost vs resilience.
- Design for change: stable contracts, reversible decisions, incremental migrations, and small blast radius.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- Beginner mistakes: memorizing definitions without tracing real execution, ignoring edge cases, and relying on defaults without understanding them.
- Intermediate mistakes: over-engineering too early, hiding failures behind generic catch blocks, under-testing boundaries, and treating logs as observability.
- Senior-level blind spots: creating shared abstractions without ownership, optimizing local performance while harming system behavior, missing migration risk, and ignoring operational cost.
- Interview mistakes: answering only the happy path, skipping trade-offs, failing to discuss scale, and not explaining how to debug production incidents.
- Production mistakes: missing timeouts, missing idempotency, no rollback path, no load testing, weak dashboards, and unclear ownership during incidents.

## 🧩 System Design Mapping

- System Design: Use this category to reason about requirements, constraints, interfaces, state, consistency, failure handling, and operational readiness.
- Microservices: Map responsibilities to service boundaries, contracts, deployment ownership, observability, and independent scaling needs.
- Performance: Identify hot paths, remove unnecessary work, define budgets, measure tail latency, and profile before optimizing.
- Scalability: Plan for horizontal growth, bounded queues, partitioning, caching, backpressure, and graceful degradation.
- Security: Apply least privilege, validate boundaries, protect secrets, audit sensitive actions, and assume dependencies can be compromised.
- Reliability: Define SLOs, expose health signals, test failure modes, and prepare rollback or compensation paths before incidents.
